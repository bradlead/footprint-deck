  Simon Watson "Three things we need to do to help customers manage their carbon footprint. 
  1. Give better information about their carbon footprint
  2. Nudge customers to make changes in their daily lives
  3. Educate and create awareness. When our customers make life choices how can we provide advice and guidance."
